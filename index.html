How to Fix Your Website on GitHub Pages
I'm glad the test page worked! Now let's get your full website working step-by-step. I'll explain everything as if you're completely new to this.
Step 1: Add Your Website Files (One at a Time)

Go to your repository

Open GitHub.com and sign in
Click on your profile picture (top right)
Select "Your repositories"
Click on "musclenflo" repository


Start with the HTML structure

Click on your index.html file
Click the pencil icon (top right) to edit
Delete the test page code
Paste ONLY the basic HTML structure of your website:



html<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Name | Content Strategist</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Coming Soon</h1>
    <p>My full content strategy website is under construction.</p>
</body>
</html>
